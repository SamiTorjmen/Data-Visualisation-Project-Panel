# Data-Visualisation-Project-Panel
This repository is a data visualization project that utilizes the Python-based open-source dashboarding framework, Panel. The project aims to provide a flexible, user-friendly, and interactive data exploration and visualization platform for users to gain insights into large datasets.

The project includes various data visualization components such as bar charts, scatterplots, line charts, and heatmaps, which can be dynamically updated and filtered based on user-defined selection criteria. Panel's built-in widgets, sliders, and dropdowns provide a simple and intuitive interface to interact with the data and modify visualizations on-the-fly.
